What exactly is Hide4PGP?

Hide4PGP is a freeware program distributed as source code
in ANSI C and precompiled executables for DOS (any version
but 1.x - is there one outside the museum?), OS/2 (Warp
and up), and the Win32 console (9x and NT). It's purpose
is to hide any data in a way that the viewer or listener
does not recognize any difference. This is called steganography.
Hide4PGP can use the following file formats:

BMP
Bitmap formats of Windows 3.x (the most common), OS/2 1.x and
OS/2 2.x (the OS/2 2.x format is an extension of the Windows
3.x format, an this is an extension of OS/2 1.x format); the only
restriction: the bitmaps must not be compressed (run length
encoded).

WAV
the standard sound format of Windows; you can use all formats
(low - 8 bit, medium - 12 bit, or high quality - 16 bit, voice
or CD, mono or stereo); the same restriction as above: it must
be uncompressed PCM format (the most common one I suppose)

VOC
a proprietary format of Creative Labs, widely used in past days;
only the 8 bit version is supported

Hide4PGP was designed as a supplement to versions 2.x of the powerful
freeware encryption program Pretty Good Privacy by Phil Zimmermann
preferably together with Stealth by Henry Hastur (found in the PGP
2.6 source), but it can be used with any data. Using it together with
Stealth and PGP makes it nearly impossible to prove that there are
really hidden data.
