NICETEXT is a package that converts any file into
pseudo-natural-language text. 

It also has the ability to recover the original file
from the text! 

The expandable set of tools can: 

*	Create custom dictionaries from a variety of sources. 
*	Simulate many different writing styles by example! 
*	Alternatively use Context-Free-Grammars to control writing style. 


It is the result of Mark Chapman's Masters Thesis
research at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee
under the advisement of Dr. George Davida. 

The concepts were originally presented at the
International Conference on Information and Computer
Security in 1997. Updates the to software were introduced
in October, 2001 at the Information Security Conference
ISC'01.

Note:
As academically interesting as this research is, it amounts
to a computationally simple substitution cipher that would
be easy to detect and trivial to break. Although it is
possible that it could thwart unsophisticated censorship
or eavesdropping efforts, it merely provides a "thin veil"
that any cryptographically sophisticated entity could easily
see through. At this point, the research process itself has
been quite satisfying. The output of the program, we hope,
can be viewed as entertaining, or neat. In no circumstances
should anyone rely on this package as a safeguard against
eavesdropping or tampering.
