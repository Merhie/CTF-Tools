Camera/Shy

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

ADVISORY: The following program may prove destabilizing for dictators. 

LUBBOCK, TX, July 4 - Camera/Shy, a browser-based steganography application
from HACKTIVISMO, will be released at the H2K2 Convention in New York City
on July 13th. Camera/Shy was developed for democracy activists operating
from behind national firewalls. It allows users to trade in banned content
across the Internet. Camera/Shy is the debut release from Hacktivismo, a
special operations group sponsored by the CULT OF THE DEAD COW. Hacktivismo
offers technical solutions to the human rights community, and has over thirty
associates from North America, Europe, Russia, Israel, Australia, Taiwan,
and Korea. 

"I'm really proud of everyone in the group", said Hacktivismo founder, Oxblood
Ruffin. "They've made a commitment to bringing a Constitutional Toolkit to
the Internet. And although not all of us are Americans, we share the
fundamental ideals of the Constitution of the United States, especially
freedom of speech. Camera/Shy is a small first step in sharing that privilege". 

Camera/Shy will be released open source under the GNU General Public License.
It is dedicated to the memory of Wang Ruowang, former doyen of the Chinese
dissident community, a study in courage, and a lamp unto our feet. 

CAMERA/SHY OVERVIEW
Sometimes hiding the truth is the best way to protect it, and yourself. Designed
with the non-technical user in mind, Camera/Shy's "one touch" encryption process
delivers banned content across the Internet in seconds. Utilizing LSB steganographic
techniques and AES-256 bit encryption, this application enables users to share
censored information with their friends by hiding it in plain view as ordinary
gif images. Camera/Shy is the only steganographic tool that automatically scans
for and delivers decrypted content straight from the Web. It is a stand-alone,
Internet Explorer-based browser that leaves no trace on the user's system. As a
safety feature Camera/Shy also includes security switches for protection against
malicious HTML. Picture that.
